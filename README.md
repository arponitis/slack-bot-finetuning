# Fine-tuning TinyLlama on Custom Chat Data

This project demonstrates fine-tuning the TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 model on a custom dataset of chat conversations using the Hugging Face Transformers and PEFT libraries in Google Colab. The goal is to adapt the model to the style and content of a specific chat environment, enabling it to generate responses that are more aligned with the communication patterns of that group.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1.  **Dependency Installation**: Installing necessary libraries like `transformers`, `peft`, `datasets`, `bitsandbytes`, and `accelerate`.
2.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading chat data (specifically from a Slack export in this example), cleaning it by removing irrelevant messages, and structuring it into instruction-response pairs for fine-tuning.
3.  **Dataset Creation**: Converting the processed data into a Hugging Face `Dataset` object.
4.  **Tokenization**: Tokenizing the chat data using the TinyLlama tokenizer, preparing it for model input.
5.  **Model Loading with QLoRA**: Loading the TinyLlama model and applying Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) for efficient fine-tuning with reduced memory usage.
6.  **Training**: Setting up training arguments and fine-tuning the model on the custom dataset using the Hugging Face `Trainer`.
7.  **Saving Adapters**: Saving the trained LoRA adapters.
8.  **Inference**: Demonstrating how to load the base model and the fine-tuned adapters to perform inference and generate text based on a given prompt.

## Learnings

Through this project, I gained experience with:

*   Using the Hugging Face ecosystem for loading and fine-tuning large language models.
*   Applying PEFT techniques, specifically QLoRA, for efficient fine-tuning on limited resources.
*   Preprocessing custom text data for language model training.
*   Setting up a training pipeline using the Hugging Face `Trainer`.
*   Performing inference with a fine-tuned model.
*   Understanding the process of adapting a general-purpose language model to a specific domain or style.

## Future Tasks

Here are some potential future enhancements and tasks for this project:

*   **Experiment with Hyperparameters**: Explore different QLoRA parameters (e.g., `r`, `lora_alpha`, `lora_dropout`) and training arguments (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) to optimize performance.
*   **Evaluate Model Performance**: Implement metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated text and compare the fine-tuned model's performance against the base model.
*   **Support Different Chat Data Formats**: Extend the data loading and preprocessing steps to handle chat data from other platforms (e.g., Teams, Discord, custom formats).
*   **Explore Other PEFT Methods**: Experiment with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques besides QLoRA.
*   **Integrate with a Deployment Framework**: Explore deploying the fine-tuned model for use in a chat bot or other applications.
*   **Add More Data**: Train on a larger and more diverse dataset to potentially improve the model's ability to capture the nuances of the chat style.
*   **Implement More Sophisticated Preprocessing**: Explore advanced text cleaning and preparation techniques.
